#? What is a variable?
#* A variable is a named storage location that holds a value. It acts as a container for storing data that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program. 

#? What is a data type?
#* Data types represent the kind of value that a variable can hold. 

a = 17;     # Integer
b = True;   # Boolean
c = "Aman"; # String
d = None;   # NoneType
print(a);

# Getting the type of the variable
print("Type of a is", type(a));
print("Type of b is", type(b));
print("Type of c is", type(c));
print("Type of d is", type(d));

"""
# Output:
    - Type of a is <class 'int'>
    - Type of b is <class 'bool'>
    - Type of c is <class 'str'>
    - Type of d is <class 'NoneType'>

"""
The above code snippet is an example of a multi-line comment in Python. It is enclosed 
within three double quotation marks and can span multiple lines. Multi-line comments 
are typically used to provide detailed explanations of code or to temporarily disable 
a block of code.

print("Hello, World!")

#? Escape Sequence
#? The first line of code prints a string that contains a newline character. The \n in the string creates a new line when the string is printed.
#? The second line of code prints a string that includes a single quote within single quotes. To include a single quote within a single quote string, we use a backslash (\) before the single quote to escape it.
#? The third line of code prints a string that includes a double quote within double quotes. To include a double quote within a double quote string, we use a backslash (\) before the double quote to escape it.
#? The fourth line of code prints a string that shows how to represent a new line character as \n.
print("This is a string with a newline\ncharacter.")

print('\'Add Single Quote\' in Single Quote String.');
print("\"Add Double Quote\" in Double Quote String.");
print("New Line: '\\n'");

#? The code is using the print function to display a message on the output screen. The message includes the words "Hello", "World!", and "2023". The sep parameter is set to ", " which means a comma and space will be used to separate the values. The end parameter is set to "!\n" which means an exclamation mark and a new line character will be added at the end of the message.
print("Hello", "World!", "2023", sep=", ", end="*\n");

print("Author: ", "Aman S. Gupta");

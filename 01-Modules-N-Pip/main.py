# Module means code written by someone else that you can use

'''
- `pip` is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage external modules. It comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

- Modules in Python are files that contain Python code and can be imported into other Python files. They can be either internal (built-in) or external (third-party).

- External modules can be installed using `pip`. To install a module, you can use the command `pip install <module_name>` in your terminal or command prompt. Once installed, you can import the module in your Python code using the `import` statement.

- Internal modules are included with Python and can be used without installing any additional software. They can be imported in the same way as external modules.
